## My process

I chose to do this frontend mentor challenge as simply as possible. I wanted to just use HTML and vanilla CSS to see if I could replicate the QR-code component. I know there are other easier ways to do this, but I wanted to get better with positioning elements on the page with vanilla css so I chose to do it this way.

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS

### What I learned

A bit more about absolute positioning
.main-section { border-radius: 10px; position: absolute;

### Continued development

I want to redo the project using flexbox and grid to see how each method differs in difficulty.
